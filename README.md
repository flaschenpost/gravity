# gravity
some simple gravity simulation, with nice fractals as result.

A few "stars" with fixed positions and the same mass influence stones that start at several positions with speed=0.

The stones fall towards the stars and create nice movements, and finally (because of a small built-in speed reduction in each step) they land on one of the stars.

But which start position leads to which of the stars? The starting point is colored with the color of the final star.

Some bunches of stones are dancing around and around the stars. Others fall quickly into one of the stars.
